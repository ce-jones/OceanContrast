# auto_SAR_Ocean_Contrast \(autonomous Ocean Contrast Estimation for SAR Images\)

# Installation

## 1. Requirements
The GeoTIFF interface requires *libgdal 3.8.4* or later.  There are many ways 
to install this on your system, e.g., macports (*port install gdal*).  This should happen automatically when following the instructions below.

The code works with python 3.8 and possibly later versions depending upon the processor on your computer.  Note: The code was tested on an M1 Mac and worked with python 3.9.

## 2. Installation 

./install [NewCondaEnvironmentName] [PythonVersion] 

if NewCondaEnvironmentName is specified, a new Conda environment is created and installation occurs there.  Otherwise, installation is in the base environment.
