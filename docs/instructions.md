## 1. Input files
The code requires a calibrated SAR image file and an incidence angle file or layer on the same grid as the image.  The input can be in one of the three following formats:

**Geotiff**

Band 1 - Calibrated SAR image (in linear units or dB)  
Band 2 - Incidence angle \(in degrees or radians\)  
Optional Band 3 - Latitude \(not used by this code\)  
Optional Band 4 - Longitude \(not used by this code\)  

**ENVI Binary Raster**  
This option is intended to work with UAVSAR geocoded .grd files from the UAVSAR PolSAR standard product, using the incidence angle .inc file provided.  These are flat binary files in real*4 format (32-bit floating point). An ENVI .hdr file is required to specify the dimensions of the grid and the georeferencing, if provided.  The code works for data in radar coordinates or in geographical coordinates.

**NetCDF**  
The code also works with a NetCDF file in the [NOAA CoastWatch](https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cwn/data-access-tools/coastwatch-data-portal.html) file format.  This file contains the calibrated image with land masked out and an incidence angle layer.

*Information on the NOAA CoastWatch file format is [here](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/socd/coastwatch/cwf/cw_cf_metadata.pdf).  We make no commitment that this description is up-to-date so check the [sample input data file](https://github.com/ce-jones/OceanContrast/edit/main/docs/instructions.md#4-sample-data) to see the contents.*

**Optional Land Mask**  
In the mask, values 0=water and 1=land.  The land mask is a flat binary file in real*4 format (32-bit floating point). An ENVI .hdr file is required to specify the dimensions of the grid.  There must be a 1:1 correspondence between the land mask grid and the NRCS file grid.  

## 2. Instructions for running the code

The Jupyer Notebook **auto_calc_contrast_in_ocean.ipynb** contains the code for the algorithm and shows example output with debug mode enabled.  In the first code block the user sets the working directory \(parameter *wd*\) and whether to display additional plots at intermediate steps in the processing \(*debug = True*\).  The python code **auto_calc_contrast_in_ocean.py** is a stand-alone version that is easier to use when processing multiple files.

A **config.yaml** file is used to describe input data and select processing options. The directory [prototypes/ FIX THIS LINK](github.com/nasa-jpl/AutoOceanContrast/main/prototypes) contains example files for each input data format, which can be edited and renamed to config.yaml for running the code.  The config.yaml file needs to be in the working directory (top level).  

The config.yaml file specifies the following:  
 - input and output file formats  
 - input file names \(wildcards and subdirectories accepted\)  
 - output directory  
 - whether the input NRCS is in dB or linear units  
 - whether the incidence angle is in degrees or radians
 - polarization mode \(e.g., VV, HH, HV, VH\)
 - whether to set either upper or lower incidence angle limits and their values  
 - The incidence angle bin size \(*incangbinsize*\) is used to account for the NRCS dependence on incidence angle and usually can be set to 1-2 degrees.  The exception is if the total angular range is small (~<3 degrees) in which case smaller bin size must be used to have sufficient points for the fit.
 - a flag to specify whether an enternal land mask is to be applied and the landmask file name
 - The *bootstrap* option is for hard-to-ID areas and uses the previous bin's clean water NRCS to search for the current clean water peak.  

FOR ENVI: 
 - infiles is used to identify the likely clean water pixels and the base filenames for UAVSAR products
 - filetypes specifies all the polarizations to be analyzed (since UAVSAR products come with quad-polarization output)
 - file extenstion for the incidence angle file (there should be one per base filename)

FOR NETCDF: The config.yaml file for NetCDF input also contains a list of the variables in the input file that must be kept in the output file to match the NOAA CoastWatch format.


## 3. Output files
The code generates two main outputs, either as layers \(netCDF\) or separate files \(GeoTIFF, ENVI\), several JPG images visualizing the results, and one JPG showing the statistical distribution of the ocean NRCS values and the threshold chosen automatically for identifying "radar-dark" pixels. 

Presently, this code can handle ENVI, GeoTIFF, and NetCDF formats on the input side.  The output can either be the same format or ENVI format.  No protection is written for invalid output formats -- the code will just crash.
